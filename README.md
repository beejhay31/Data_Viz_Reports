# Data_Viz_Reports 

The repo contains reports built using Power BI. 

It contains a report of real estate data and another report of customer info Data.

The real estate data was gathered via web scraping using Python 

The customer info data came as a PostgreSQL database


Played around with Power BI to see how powerful the tool is and how well it can integrate with different data hosted on different platforms.

Power BI is a great tool
